Interactive prototype modeling bank fragility to a generalized audience 
#Silicon Valley-Style Bank Stress Protype 
This project is an interactive, user-facing prototype to present how balance-sheet risk and deposit behavior can increase into wider systemic stress,as seen during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.
##Purpose
- Thematic exploration through teaching and research
- The simplified stress scenario is based on conditions at the banks
- Clarifies fragility mechanisms for non-expert audiences
