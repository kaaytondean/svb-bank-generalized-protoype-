**Silicon Valley-Style Bank Stress Protype**



This project is an interactive, user-facing prototype to present how balance-sheet risk and deposit behavior can increase into wider systemic stress,as seen during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.



**Purpose**
- Thematic exploration through teaching and research
- The simplified stress scenario is based on conditions at the banks
- Clarifies fragility mechanisms for non-expert audiences




**Core Risk Drivers**
- Interest rate shocks
- Asset duration exposure
- Uninsured deposit concentration
- Withdrawal speed
- Unrealized losses
